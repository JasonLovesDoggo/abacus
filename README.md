### Development

1. Install Golang & Redis

2. Run `go mod install` to install the dependencies
                                                   
3. Add a `.env` file to the root of the project (or set the environment variables manually) following the format specified in .env.example

4. Run `air` (if installed) or `go run .` to build and run the API locally.

5. The API will be running on `http://0.0.0.0:8080` by default.
